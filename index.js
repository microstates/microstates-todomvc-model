 * and generate state and transitions for the value. The state will be bound to the template and rendered.
 * Transitions will be used to create actions that will transition the state and update the DOM tree.
 *
 * Types describe:
 * 1. The structure of the state that the type represents.
 * 2. The custom transitions that can be performed on this type.
 * 3. The computed properties that should be applied to the state object that's derived from this type.
